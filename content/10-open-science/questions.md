## How to Track Large Data or Image Files using Git?

 Large data or image files such as `.md5` or `.psd` file types can be tracked within 
 a github repository using the [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com)
 open source extension tool.  This tool automatically uploads large file contents to 
 a remote server and replaces the file with a text pointer within the github repository.
 
 Try downloading and installing the Git Large File Storage extension tool, then add 
 tracking of a large file to your github repository.  Ask a colleague to clone your
 repository and describe what they see when they access that large file.

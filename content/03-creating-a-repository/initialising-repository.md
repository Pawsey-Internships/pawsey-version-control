Once Git is configured,
we can start using it.

We will continue with the story of Wolfman and Dracula who are investigating if it
is possible to send a planetary lander to Mars.

First, let's create a directory in our home folder for our work and then move into that directory:

```Bash
$ cd ~/
$ mkdir planets
$ cd planets
```

Then we tell Git to make `planets` a [repository]({{ page.root }}{% link reference.md %}#repository)
-- a place where Git can store versions of our files:


```Bash
$ git init
```

It is important to note that `git init` will create a repository that
includes subdirectories and their files---there is no need to create
separate repositories nested within the `planets` repository, whether
subdirectories are present from the beginning or added later. Also, note
that the creation of the `planets` directory and its initialization as a
repository are completely separate processes.

If we use `ls` to show the directory's contents,
it appears that nothing has changed:

```Bash
$ ls
```

But if we add the `-a` flag to show everything,
we can see that Git has created a hidden directory within `planets` called `.git`:

```Bash
$ ls -a
```

```Bash
.	..	.git
```

Git uses this special subdirectory to store all the information about the project, 
including all files and sub-directories located within the project's directory.
If we ever delete the `.git` subdirectory,
we will lose the project's history.

We can check that everything is set up correctly
by asking Git to tell us the status of our project:

```Bash
$ git status
```

```Bash
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```


If you are using a different version of `git`, the exact
wording of the output might be slightly different.

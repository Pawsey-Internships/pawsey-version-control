**key points:**
- The `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md`, or `LICENSE.txt` file is often used in a repository to indicate how the contents of the repo may be used by others.
- People who incorporate General Public License (GPL'd) software into their own software must make their software also open under the GPL license; most other open licenses do not require this.
- The Creative Commons family of licenses allow people to mix and match requirements and restrictions on attribution, creation of derivative works, further sharing, and commercialization.
- People who are not lawyers should not try to write licenses from scratch.
- Add a CITATION file to a repository to explain how you want your work cited.

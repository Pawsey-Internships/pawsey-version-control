Please see [this section of the workshop template][workshop-setup]
for instructions on installing Git.

We'll do our work in the `Desktop` folder so make sure you change your working directory to it with:

~~~
$ cd
$ cd Desktop
$ git --version # Check to see if Git is installed on your system
$ open https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#git # Installation instructions for Git
~~~
{: .language-bash}

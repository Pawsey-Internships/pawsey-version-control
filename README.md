# Pawsey internship Version control workshop

version-control
===============

An introduction to the software version control using Git and GitHub.
Please see <https://pawsey-internships.github.io/version-control/> for a rendered version of this material. 

The content is based on the Software Carpentries ["Version Control with Git"](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) workshop, which was forked in November 2021. 
However, the content has been substantially altered to fit the needs of the Pawsey Internship cohort(s), and the 
workshop has been reformatted using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).


## Maintainers and Contributors

In addition to any contributors on the Carpentries github above as at November 2021, the following Intern Mentors
have contributed to the building of this workshop:

* [Edric Matwiejew](https://pawsey.org.au/alumni/)

* [Melissa Speer](https://pawsey.org.au/alumni/)
* [David Adams](https://pawsey.org.au/alumni/)

## How to Build

This should be automatically hosted on github pages. But for development

``` sh
hugo server
```

## Things left to consider/TODO

1. Carpentries key points summary
found under episodes->key points has a nice once page summary of everything
2. Carpentries glossary
